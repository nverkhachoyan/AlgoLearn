# Module Progression Logic Change

## Problem

Previously, when a user saved progress on a module, we would automatically set up the next module in sequence as their "next" module. This created an issue where if a user revisited an earlier module (e.g., to review content), their progress would be reset to that module plus one, effectively losing their place in the course.

For example:

1. User completes modules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. User revisits module 2 for review
3. System would set module 3 as the "next" module instead of keeping module 6 as the next one

## Solution

We've implemented a solution that tracks the furthest module a user has reached in a course, preventing their progress from being reset when they revisit earlier modules.

### Changes Made

1. **Added a `furthest_module_id` field to the `user_courses` table**

   - This tracks the furthest module a user has reached in each course
   - Updated automatically via a database trigger when module progress changes

2. **Created a trigger function `update_furthest_module_id()`**

   - When a module's progress is updated, this function checks if it's further than the current furthest module
   - Only updates the furthest_module_id if the new module is further in the course sequence

3. **Modified the progression logic**
   - Added `isCurrentModuleFurthest()` helper function to check if a module is the user's furthest progress point
   - Only create "next module" progress entries if the user is completing their furthest module
   - This prevents progress resets when revisiting earlier modules

### SQL Queries Added

Two new SQL queries were added to support this functionality:

1. `GetFurthestModuleID` - Retrieves the furthest module ID for a user in a course
2. `IsModuleFurtherThan` - Compares two modules to determine which is further in the course sequence

### How It Works

1. When a user saves progress on a module, we check if it's their furthest module
2. If it is the furthest (or a new furthest module), we set up the next module as usual
3. If the user is revisiting an earlier module, we don't change their next module progress

This ensures that users can freely revisit earlier modules without losing their place in the course progression.

## Migration

A new migration file (`000012_add_furthest_module_id.up.sql`) has been added to implement these changes. Run the migration to apply the changes to your database.
